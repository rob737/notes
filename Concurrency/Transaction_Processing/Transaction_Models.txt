Note that atomicity is defined only from the perspective of the caller of the operation, 
because almost no atomic action—including machine instructions—is truly atomic at all levels of implementation.

At hardware level, the block on disk can be left half-changed, and the controller returns an error code indicating that this happened.

It might even produce a normal return code in spite of the fact that, 
due to some transient error in the controller’s circuitry or a fault in the disk media, the block was not written correctly. 
And if there is a power loss in the middle of the operation, it might happen that the first part of the block is written, but the rest is not. 
In all these cases the outcome of the action is neither all nor nothing, but something in between.

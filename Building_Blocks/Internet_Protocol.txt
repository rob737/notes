---------------------------------------------- Doubts -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Read about DHCP 
2. Difference between MAC address and IP address ?
   I think MAC address is to identify the device within the same subnet while IP address is for broader network.

3. Does NIC has IP/MAC address or is there any other hardware in our computer that is assigned the IP/MAC address?

4. Difference between a switch and a router?

-- IP packets deal only with source and destination IP addresses i.e. it is layer 3 protocol.

-- It doesn't care about information from other layers like port from Layer 4 etc.

----- IP address :

It can be set automatically or statically.

IPv4 is 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits.

IP address has network and host portion.

e.g. a.b.c.d/x where x represents the number of bits that represents the network and d represents the host in the network.

e.g. 192.168.254.0/24 , we can have 2^24 networks and 2^8 hosts in each network.

These hosts are also called subnet as in subnetworks within a larger network.

----- Subnet Mask :

It is used to determine whether an IP is in same subnet or another subnet.

It's value is 255.255.255.0

e.g. 192.156.234.5 and 192.234.123.12 are not in the same subnet as 255.255.255.0 & 192.156.234.5 and 255.255.255.0 & 192.234.123.12 are 
not same.

Note: & operation with 255 will effectively give the same number as result. (Why?)

2^8 is 256 but 0 is the loopback address which is reserved so with 8 bits we can have 2^8 -1 combinations which is basically all 1's which equates to 255.

------ Default Gateway :

If hosts are in same subnet then they can interact with each other using MAC addresses.

However, if they are not in the same subnet then source host need to talk to gateway which in turn will forward the packet to destination host or another 
gateway accordingly.

Default gateway also has an assigned IP address. Technically, this is what we call a Router.

Hmm, Interestingly default gateway can have number of IP addresses equal to the number of subnet it connects to.


------- Anatomy of IP Packet :

Ip packet has headers and data sections.

headers are usually 20 bytes while data section can go upto 65536 bytes (i.e. 2^16).

Note: headers with some configurations can go upto 60 bytes.

MTU : Maximum Transmission Unit i.e. maximum number of bytes that can be sent over in a packet.
It's way less than what data section allows.

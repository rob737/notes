------------------------------- Doubt ----------------------------------

1. What is the difference between SSE and Http ? Is Http a protocol and SSE is a design pattern built using HTTP?
   like spring is a framework built using java ?

2. Difference between SSE and Websocket ?   

3. Can SSE be used only with Http1.1 ?

--- Server Sent Events :

Client establishes a connection over Http and then server can keep on sending data unless client closes the connection via TCP FIN flag.

SSE is over HTTP so it's support range is very high, we need not have explicit protocol support like we need for websocket.

Response is basically a stream of chunks sent whenever there is something to be sent.

Client parses the stream data and processes events.

Note : Http 1.0 doesn't support streaming.

SSE content-type header let's us identify it uniquely. (content-type : text/event-stream)


Pros  :

- Real time
- Compatible with Http.

Cons :

- Clients must be online

- Clients might not be able to handle the load as server just sends the data when it has some data.

- Polling is preferred for light clients.

- Http/1.1 problem (6 TCP connections limit for simultaneous connection to a particular domain) -- THis is specific for chrome but almost all browsers follow it.

- Events or response must start with keyword "data" and must end with 2 new lines.

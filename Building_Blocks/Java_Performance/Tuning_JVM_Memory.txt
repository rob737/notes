---- How the String Pool is implemented ?

It is implemented as a hash map.

so, String can be referenced in String Pool by finding the right index.

Note: Two identical objects will always have the same hashcode.


---- Understanding the size and density of the String pool :

-XX:+PrintStringTableStatistics will give us information about the String Pool (We need to refer to StringTable statistics and not the SymbolTable statistics) :

StringTable statistics:

StringTable statistics:
Number of buckets       :     65536 =    524288 bytes, each 8
Number of entries       :   1000089 =  16001424 bytes, each 16
Number of literals      :   1000089 =  48006560 bytes, avg  48.002
Total footprsize_t         :           =  64532272 bytes
Average bucket size     :    15.260
Variance of bucket size :    80.825
Std. dev. of bucket size:     8.990
Maximum bucket size     :        42

Process finished with exit code 0



Note: Unlike regular HashMap, Number of buckets are not resized.

bucket is nothing but array index.


---- Tuning the size of the String Pool :


We can use the flag 

-XX:StringTableSize=<any_prime_number_greater_than_default_bucket_size>


Note: Total footprsize_t is the amount of memory required in bytes to run the program.

Note: Higher bucket size will most probably would reduce collission and hence inserting and retrieval time would reduce.


Note: As a rough rule, if average bucket size is more than 50 then play around by modifying the size of the bucket.


---- Tuning the size of the heap :

String pool lives in the heap.

Execute below command to get all information related to JVM :


java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal 


we will get following flags giving corresponding information about the heap:

size_t MinHeapSize                              = 8388608

size_t MaxHeapSize                              = 4034920448

size_t InitialHeapSize                          = 253755392


Above information is in bytes.

So MaxHeapSize is roughly around 4 GB.



Note: Above values are default values as per our machine.

we can change above configuration using flag : -XX:MaxHeapSize=  and -XX:InitialHeapSize=

Shortcut for :

-XX:MaxHeapSize is -Xmx

-XX:InitialHeapSize is -Xms

i.e. Syntax for setting Initial Heap size in shortcut notation would be -Xms1g

Note: we don't use "=" sign in shortcut notation and put the value after the flag.

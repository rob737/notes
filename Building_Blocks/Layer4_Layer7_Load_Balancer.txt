1. Understand what NAT is?


------------------------------------ XXXXX ------------------------------------------


---- Layer 4 load balancer :

-- It deals with only ports and IP addresses.

-- Hence, unit of action is segments (assuming TCP protocol).

-- Request from client will be forwarded to "only one connection" i.e. only one port.

Effectively, there are 2 TCP connections formed, one from client to reverse proxy and from reverse proxy to destination server.

Hence, connection is effectively used to know about client and server as one connection will correspond to one request otherwise 
TCP order of delivery cannot be guaranteed i.e. all segments of a request must be passed through one connection.

It is what is called a "Sticky Connection".


Since, layer 4 is not aware of any higher level protocols, we can use this to support any protocol as per our wish.



---- Pros of Layer 4 load balancer :

- Simple load balancer that deals with PORT, IP Address and Connection.

- Efficient as no actual data lookup is required.

- More secure as it need not read the actual content of the request.

- Works with any protocol (layer 7 protocol).

- It can work with one TCP connection in NAT configuration. 


---- Cons of Layer 4 load balancer :

- No smart load balancing decision can be made as we can't lookup the contents of request.

- Sticky per connection i.e. one connection once established cannot be used by another client.

- Being protocol unaware can be dangerous as it can be used to bypass rules.


---- Layer 7 Load Balancer :

- It decrypts and understands the content of request.

- It buffers the content of request.

- A request is basically a complete message ( i.e. one message with all components of Http like protocol, path, header, body etc)
  Check Http Anatomy notes for actual components of Http Message.
  
- certificate needs to live in layer 7 as it decrypts the content.



---- Pros of Layer 7 load balancer :

- Smart load balancing can happen as we can read the contents of the request.
  Example : routing based on the url path.

- Caching is possible.

- API gateway logic

- Authentication logic 


Basically, the fact that Layer 7 load balancer can lookup the contents of the request gives it an upper hand to 
do many precomputations.


---- Cons of Layer 7 load balancer :

- Expensive/Overhead of computing request data.

- Overhead of decryption (terminate TLS) : Layer 7 load balancer must do it.

- Two TCP connections as there is a way that Layer 4 can use one connection (Read about NAT and understand this point).

- Must share TLS certificate i.e. TLS certificate must reside at reverse proxy.

- Needs to buffer the request to understand it's contents.

- Needs to understand protocol. Since, it does layer 7 load balancing which is effectively understanding the content/protocol .

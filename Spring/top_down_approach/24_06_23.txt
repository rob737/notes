Q. What are annotations exactly?

Annotations basically gives additional information or instruction to the compiler or runtime environment.

Q. How Java understands what it needs to do with @Bean annotation? I mean somewhere code needs to be present that tells it 
that if @Bean is defined, create an object while startup and register it in application context.

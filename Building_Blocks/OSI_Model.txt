----------------------------------------------- Doubt --------------------------------------------------------

1. How eaxctly light represents bits? How fiber transmits data ? This is some super stuff.

2. What is protocol ossification?

3. What actually is a frame in Layer 2 ? Specifically, what does it represent? How is it different from datagram, segment and IP packets?

4. Difference between Switch and Router ?

5. What is a subnet ? What is the role of subnet with respect to a switch?

6. Can lower level layers at receiver access higher level information e.g. can switch that typically acts
   with layer 2 i.e. MAC address details can somehow access layer 3 i.e. IP information?

   Ans : No, it can access information present in lower level but not of higher layer.

-- OSI : Open Systems Interconnection

OSI is an abstract concept that provides a common mode of communication between two systems.
You can call it a language that all systems can talk in.

There are 7 layers in OSI model, stating below these 7 layers from top to bottom :

Note : Lower order layer will not have access to information that is propretiary to higher order layer but vice versa is feasible.
       example layer 4 deals with port and layer 3 deals with IP, layer 3 will not have access to port information but layer 4 will have 
       access to layer 3 information.


---- Layer 7 : Application layer 

-- Http, FTP, gRPC etc. Technically our application code along with it's processing data resides at this layer.


---- Layer 6 : Presentation Layer 

-- Serialization and Encoding happens at this level e.g. serialization of text to UTF8 etc.


---- Layer 5 : Session Layer 

-- Responsible for creating connection, TLS, maintaining state at client/server and all other tasks that can be related to session management. 

-- After SYN ACK, creates connection


---- Layer 4 : Transport Layer 

-- packets in TCP is called segments and in UDP, it is called datagram.

-- TCP/UDP resides at layer 4.

-- We have visibility till ports.

-- Sends SYN request

-- Default port for Https is 443

-- It assembles all the packets at receiver end such that business logic can be performed at presentation or application layer.


---- Layer 3 : Network Protocol 

-- Packet that has only IP information accessible i.e. all it cares about or filter about is IP.

-- We have visibility only till IP addresses and not ports.


---- Layer 2 : Data link - Frames, Mac Address

-- This layer basically represents the actual physical device/hardware.

-- We send frames in layer 2, packets in layer 3, segments in TCP and datagram in UDP (Layer 4).

-- It has MAC address information.

---- Layer 1 : Physical - Electric Signals (Ethernet), Fiber (Light waves) or radio waves (Wifi) 

-- How we transport frames to other systems.

-- Electric signal represents binary numbers.

-- Network Interface Card belongs to layer 1. 



Basically, lower layer is contained within higher layer in case of receiver as receiver starts from layer 1 to layer 7 

while sender starts from layer 7 and goes down till layer 1 so sender keeps putting higher layer data into layer level unit.

e.g. In sender, TCP segment would be put into IP packet and IP packet into data frame which would be sent over to receiver.
(Each unit would have sender and receiver information.)

To sum up, each layer has access to corresponding information and act on that information. 


----- Switch and Router :

Switch has access till Data link layer i.e. layer 1 and Layer 2 and acts on Layer 2 i.e. data frames.

Router has access till Network layer i.e. Layer 1, Layer 2 and Layer 3 and acts on Layer 3 i.e. IP packets.


Alternatively, we can say that router is a Layer 3 device and switch is a layer 2 device.


Note : It is very important to understand that each layer while performing operation would take finite amount of time.


------ Layer 4 vs Layer 7 :

Layer 4 deals with segments or datagrams like port.

layer 7 deals with application data like url etc.

We have Layer 7 load balancer, CDN etc.

Firewall is at layer 4 and we also have layer 4 proxy and load balancer.

ISP is more or less layer 4 proxy.

VPN is layer 3.

Every CDN is layer 7 reverse proxy and that's it.

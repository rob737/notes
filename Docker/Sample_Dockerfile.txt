#Note: Dockerfile is to clearly document our deployment process.

#It says use base image node from docker hub for linux distribution alpine.
FROM node:alpine
#Copy all source code from current directory into app directory of image.
COPY . /app
#Set current directory as /app in the container
WORKDIR /app
#execute below command in the container.
#CMD node /app/app.js
CMD node app.js
#This image will contain node, alpine linux and our application code.
#Now, deployment is basically transferring docker image from one computer to another.

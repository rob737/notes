InMemoryUserDetailsManager class can be used for creating different users with different roles/authorization.

i.e. we can define a bean of type InMemoryUserDetailsManager which in turn implements the interface UserDetails Manager.

By default, Spring Security has User class which can be levergaed to create multiple users with username, pwd and roles/authorities.


@Bean annotation in @Configuration class creates a bean of type as per return type of method and register it in Spring context.

With this, we need not define anything in application.properties file and we can login with user credentials defined as part of 
InMemoryUserDetailsManager bean.

Note: Just by defining bean of type NoOpPasswordEncoder in @Configuration file, it will tell spring context to use this encoder instead of default encoder.

--- Threads :

Threads share process' memory but each thread has it's own program counter, stack and local variables.
Multiple threads within the same process can be scheduled on different processors simultaneously.

Most modern OS treats thread and not process for scheduling.
Since, threads share the same memory space of process, all threads share the variables and objects created.

Note: Garbage collector usually runs in one or more dedicated threads.

Since the basic unit of scheduling is thread, a single threaded application can run on atmost one processor at a time.

Doubt : Is scheduler common across all processors?

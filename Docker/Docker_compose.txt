---- what is docker compose and why do we even need it?

To manage multiple containers.
For example : let's say you want one container to only be up when some other container is up i.e. you have depedency of
container A on container B and so on.

If we are not using docker-compose then we would need to manually check above constraint.

docker compose is built on top of docker engine.

Note: we can use $(command) to execute the command dynamically and in conjunction with other commands.

Example : docker image rm $(docker image ls -q) : It will remove all images.

--- 

cd to directory where docker-compose.yml is present and do docker-compose up to start all the necessary containers.


---- JSON and YAML formats :

List are represented as separated rows using hyphen. 

e.g. 
in json, "tags" : [a,b]

in yml,
	tags :
		- a
		- b
		
Note : parsing yml file is slower than parsing JSON as every value in yml is considered string and then it is type casted to correct datatype.		


---- Understanding docker compose files :

Only  Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, compose.yml, compose.yaml

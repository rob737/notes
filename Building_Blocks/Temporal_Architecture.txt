--- Temporal


Heart Beat : Let's temporal knows that activity is still alive.

What is fan out - fan in pattern?


Design principle for temporal : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t524U9CixZ0

Implement a poller (for polling a queue) by taking reference on how worker process does it in temporal?


APIs for monitoring :

1. We can send execution metric to Prometheus and Grafana.

2. We have heart beat signals to validate if activity is running or terminated.

3. Signals to block execution until we get a particular input.

4. Query to fetch current state of execution.

5. retry & timeout.

6. compensating transaction for rollback.

7. Cron schedule.

8. namespaces for segregating workflow executions for different environments.

9. Searching workflows based on parameters other than workflow Id.



Worker uses polling.

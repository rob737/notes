1. Understand what netcat utility is (nc) that was used to connect to UDP server socket.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) :

It's called user datagram because client sets a fixed size message into underlying IP packet.

i.e. datagram or message has start and end unlike TCP which is a stream of bytes.

It is layer 4 protocol which deals in source and destination port.

Simple protocol to send and receive data. However, delivery of data is not guaranteed unlike TCP.

It's a stateless protocol i.e. every request must contain the data that is needed for effective processing of the request.
Basically, we don't store any data required for processing on server side.

It's header is of size 8 bytes.


---- UDP use cases :

-- Video Streaming

-- VPN

-- DNS

-- WebRTC : It is a protocol which uses Http over UDP.


Let's say we want to send data of multiple client processes to same server.

Client would multiplex different port information into a single IP packet containing UDP message.

Now, server would de-multiplex it and route UDP message to their corresponding application identified by port.



---- Anatomy of UDP datagram :

UDP header if we are using IPv4 is 8 bytes.

Ports are 16 bit i.e. 0 to 65535.

it contains following flags :

-- Source port of 2 bytes.

-- Destination port of 2 bytes.

-- Length of 2 bytes denotes the length of the data that is being sent.

-- Checksum of 2 bytes

-- data : user data that client wants to send to server.


----- Pros of UDP :

Uses less bandwidth as datagram is small so I think in MTU, we can send more data.

Low latency as unlike TCP, there is no handshake between client and server.









----- Cons of UDP :

There is no order, re-transmission and delivery of packets guarantee.

No acknowledgement whether packet is delivered to server or not.

Since, UDP is stateless as well as connectionless it can be used to flood routers or DNS.

OS has to process all incoming UDP datagrams so it may lead to all sort of resource wastage etc.

No flow control and No congestion control.

Flow control is basically how much server can process packets.

congestion control is basically how much router can process packets.

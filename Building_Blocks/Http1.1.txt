1. What exactly a referer parameter in header conveys?

--- Anatomy of Http 1.1 request 


method :

GET, PUT, POST, DELETE

path : <any_string_after_first_slash> or "/" if only domain name is present.

e.g. <domain_name>/<any_string_after_first_slash>


protocol :

whether it is Http1.1/1.2/1.3 or any other .

headers :

collection of key-value pairs representing the header.

e.g. cookie, referer, host etc

body : It is the payload.


Note: user agent is basically the client who has made the request.



--- Anatomy of Http1.1 Response :


Protocol : same as above

code : Like 200, 304, 404 etc.

Code Text : some sort of description of code.

Headers : same as above

Body : The actual response whose length/size is defined by the Content-Length header.


Note: Http is layer 7 protocol.


Note: Nginx is Http 1.1



---- Http1.0 vs Http1.1


-- Http1.0 

- New TCP connection everytime i.e. let's say a webpage has to download 6 images then each image will have it's new connection.
  Thus, overhead of TCP handshake is multiplied.
  
- Slow

- Buffering didn't exist (transfer-encoding:chunked didn't exist)

  i.e. all response must be sent at once.

-- Http1.1

- It has keep-alive: true/false header which can let TCP connection be active across multiple requests.

That's why we can have persisted connections. It is called persisted because connection states are persisted in both client and server memory.

- Because of persistent connection, it has lower latency and lower CPU usage as there is no overhead of 3 way handhshake again and again.

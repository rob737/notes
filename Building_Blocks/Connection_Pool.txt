1. What actually represents a domain ? name + port ? or only name ?

--- Multiplexing vs Demultiplexing (H2 proxying vs connection pooling) :


Multiplexing is basically merging multiple connections into one connections or in more general term :

combining multiple events into a single event that internally would be constituted of many events.

Demultiplexing is the reverse.


Note :

Http/2 uses multiplexing to combine multiple requests into one connection.

Reverse proxies like Nginx, Envoy receives Http/1.1 and then multiplex it to Http/2 to create one connection with backend server.

Reverse proxies also does de-multiplexing.

--- Connection pooling :


Let's say scenario is communication from backend server to DB.

backend server maintans already created connection to DB called hot connections instead of creating everytime it gets a new connection request.

It saves 3 way handshake connection time for each request.

As a matter of fact, connection pool is a general concept. Even limitation of google chrome to have atmost 
6 simultaneous connection to a domain is a case of connection pool only.

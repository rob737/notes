---- what is docker compose and why do we even need it?

To manage multiple containers.
For example : let's say you want one container to only be up when some other container is up i.e. you have depedency of
container A on container B and so on.

If we are not using docker-compose then we would need to manually check above constraint.

docker compose is built on top of docker engine.

Note: we can use $(command) to execute the command dynamically and in conjunction with other commands.

Example : docker image rm $(docker image ls -q) : It will remove all images.

--------------------------------------------- Doubts ----------------------------------------------
1. VPN vs Forward Proxy ?
- Forward Proxy terminates TLS and look at the contents whereas VPN doesnot.
- VPN operate at IP level (layer 3) whereas proxy operates at layer 4 and above.

---- Forward Proxy :


Dataflow is like below :

Client -> Forward Proxy -> Destination Server.

So, client initiates TCP connection with Forward Proxy and Forward Proxy in turn initiates connection with Destination Server.

Hence, Destination Server's request source is Forward Proxy and not the client itself.



From Layer 4, destination server is only aware of the proxy.

However, from layer 7, if we are using Http then we can enable X-Forwarded-For flags which would let destination server know about client.


-- Forward Proxy use cases :

-- Client Anonymity

-- Logging and Tracing of Client requests

-- caching 

-- Blocking Website

-- Service Mesh uses the idea of Forward proxy to be aware of all the services.


Note: Fiddler (popular debugging tool) is actually a forward proxy.



---- Reverse Proxy :

Dataflow is like below :

Client -> Reverse Proxy -> Destination Server.

Dataflow looks similar to forward proxy but reverse proxy basically hides the existence of destination server.
Hence, in Reverse Proxy client is not aware of actual destination server but of Reverse Proxy and 
in Forward Proxy, server is not aware of actual client but the forward proxy.


Client initiates connection with Reverse Proxy i.e. DNS resolution of (say google.com) will return IP address of reverse proxy which 

internally will create connections with actual google.com destination servers.

Sometimes, Reverse proxy is also called Edge Servers.

In Reverse proxy, both from layer 4 and layer 7 perspective of client, reverse proxy is the final destination. 

--- Use cases of reverse proxy :

- Load balancer

- API Gateway

- CDN

- Canary deployment or Blue-Green deployment : Deploy latest code in one of the servers and route 10% of the traffic to this newly created server
											   to test if everything is working fine.
											   
- Nginx, HAProxy all are reverse proxies.



--- Http Tunneling or SSH Tunneling :

Client sends request to Forward Proxy and Forward proxy forwards it as it is to Destination server.
Hence, if there forward proxy is allowed to create connection with Destination server then effectively we can use SSH/Http tunneling to
interact with destination server.

In simple words, Forward proxy provides a tunnel between client and destination server.

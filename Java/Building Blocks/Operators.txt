Object a = Object b.

In case of objects, reference is copied and original object can be changed.

Integer division truncates and doesn't round off the results.

== and equals() for objects :

== will compare reference for objects.

equals() unless defined specifically will also compare for references and for values if defined explicitly.

return keyword is for method level execution termination and not loop or control statement level.

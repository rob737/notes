---- Building blocks :

files are called objects and are stored in directories called buckets.

bucket must have globally unique name (across all regions and all accounts).

Important : Even though bucket name has to be unique globally, buckets are defined within a region.


Object :

Object files have a key.

key is full path of the object.
e.g. s3://my-bucket//folder1/sub_folder1/myfile.txt

key is comprised of prefix and object name.

prefix : folder1/sub_folder1/
object name : myfile.txt

At once, 5 GB can be uploaded.
If file is above 5 GB then it has to be uploaded as multi part.


After creating object, pre-signed url validates whether we have access to the resource or not.

That's why if we just copy public url and paste it in browser, we won't be able to open it.

but if click on open from your account then we are able to open it because url contains access key attributes (e.g. X-AMZ-Security-Token).

----- S3 Security Policies :

1. IAM Role based :

2. Resource based :
--- Bucket level access
--- Object ACL (Access Control List)
--- Bucket ACL (Access Control List)

3. Encryption :

Encrypt object using encryption keys.

4. S3 bucket policy :
json structure like IAM policy.

Note : Explicit DENY in an IAM Policy will take precedence over an S3 bucket policy.


----- Static Website :

S3 can load static website as well.

----- S3 Versioning :

It can be done at bucket level.

----- S3 Replication :

Prerequisite : S3 versioning is enabled in both source and destination.

-- CRR (Cross Region Replication)

Asynchronous replication

-- SRR (Same Region Replication)

Asynchronous replication

Replication is not transitive i.e. bucket 1 -> bucket 2 and bucket2 -> bucket3 doesn't imply replication between bucket1 and bucket3.


----- S3 Storage classes :

S3 Durability : 11 9's i.e. 99.999999999% durable.

S3 Availabilty For S3 Standard : 99.99% (4 9's) i.e. not available 53 minutes a year.

Classes are of following types : 

1. S3 Standard :
   -- General : for frequent access
   -- Infrequent : for infrequent access and cheaper than general. 
   both are 99.99% Availabilty.
   
2. S3 Glacier storage classes :
    Lost cost object storage meant for recovery/archiving or backup.
   -- Instant Retrieval : access within milliseconds, good for order history.
   -- Glacier flexible retrieval :
         - Expedited : access within 1 to 5 mins
		 - Standard : 3 to 5 hours
		 - bulk : 5 to 12 hours	
   -- Glacier Deep Archive
         - Standard : 12 hours
		 - Bulk : 48 hours	
		 
		 
Intelligent Tiering service :
This service automatically migrate object from one tier to another depending on access pattern.
This can be achieved by setting up lifecycle configuration for buckets.

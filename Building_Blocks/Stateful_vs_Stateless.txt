1. What exactly is a session and how is it used? e.g. sessionId etc while login



------------------------------------------XXXXXXX-------------------------------------------------------------



--- Stateful :

- some sort of state is stored somewhere in backend and correct functionality is dependent on that state.

- More specifically, information/state of client is stored in server's memory and that information is needed to perform the task correctly.


--- Stateless :

- Client is responsible for sending the state with every request.

- Server doesn't store client's state.



hmm, so stateful and stateless is with respect to the backend/server.

if backend is idle and can be re-started without any implication to workflow then it is stateless.
It can fetch data from somewhere else and work as per use case.

Note :

Sticky session is needed to route client request to a server where it was logged in to take leverage of sessionId when load balancer is introduced.
Otherwise if request goes to some other server then again it would need re-login because session information is being maintained in 
process memory.


---- Stateless vs Stateful protocols :

TCP is stateful because client and server information is stored in each other.

UDP is stateless.

Stateless protocol on stateful protocol : e.g. Http on top of TCP.

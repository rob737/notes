---
When exception is thrown, following things happen :

1. Using new operator, Exception object is created in heap.
 e.g. throw new NullPointerException();
 
--- 

Exception root class is Throwable.
we can return any type of Throwable. 

syntax :

try{

}catch(ExceptionType ex){

}

-- Creating own Exceptions

class CustomExceptionClass extends Exception {
    public CustomExceptionClass(){}
	public CustomExceptionClass(String str){super(str);}
}


Exception is inherited from Throwable class i.e. Exception extends Throwable.

-- Exception Specification

e.g. void f() throws Exception1, Exception2 {}

above declaration tells client programmer the possible Exception types that can be thrown from a method.

Note : instances of RuntimeException can be thrown even without explicit exception specification.


--- Checked Exceptions :

Exceptions that are checked and can be reported at compile time.

What is an image technically ?

An image includes everything that an application needs to run.
It consists of following and many more :
1. A cut-down OS.
2. Third-party libraries
3. Application files/code
4. Environment variables and so on.....

What is a container technically ?

A container is basically a "special" type of process that provides isolated runtime environment to execute image.
It is a special type of process because it has it's own file system that is provided by the image.

We can spin up multiple containers from the same image but it is an isolated environment so files created in one container
will be exclusive to that container.

--- Docker file :

It contains instructions for building an image (check Sample_Dockerfile.txt)

Main commands in Dockerfile :

1. FROM : to import from base image.
2. WORKDIR : to setup current working directory (similar to cd in linux).
3. COPY/ADD : To copy files from your source code to docker image.
4. RUN : To execute any OS commands once the image has an associated container and these commands run in isolation within container's filesystem.
5. ENV : to set environment variables.
6. EXPOSE : To tell docker that our container would be starting on a particular port.
7. USER : For specifying the owner or the user that should run the application.
8. CMD/ENTRYPOINT : To specify the commands that should be executed when container is started.
					Difference between CMD/ENTRYPOINT and RUN is that CMD commands are executed only once when container is starting.
					
--- Choosing the right base image :

docker build -t <tag_name> <path_of_Dockerfile>

Note : The path that we give in docker build command sets up a docker context which is sent to docker engine, docker engine 
       executes the docker file commands on that docker context and hence it has access only to those files that 
	   are present in path that is given in docker build command.
	   
	   docker context contains everything that needs to be sent to docker engine i.e. code etc.

docker run -it <image_name> <shell_name> : This command is to run newly created docker image.

--- Running commands within docker container :

Doubt : Difference between docker start and docker run ?

--- Setting Environment variables :

ENV <name>=<value>

--- Exposing ports :

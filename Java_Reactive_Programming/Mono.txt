-- Reactive Stream is the specification while Reactor is one of the implementation (i.e. library) for asynchronous non blocking stream processing.

-- Publisher is one of the interfaces which has 2 implementations :
   - Mono : It can emit 0 or 1 item followed by onComplete or onError. 
   
   - Flux : It can emit 0 to N items followed by onComplete or onError.
   
   Typical flow is as follows :
   
   Mono/Flux ------- 0..1/0..N --------------> Subscriber
		^
		|										  |	
	    ------------ Subscription Object <---------

   Note : It is pull based model i.e. Subscriber requests data from Publisher's implementation i.e. Mono/Flux.

-- Just to compare, Mono is similar to Optional while Flux is similar to Streams in Java.

-- Stream is lazy operation i.e. it would not do anything unless we connect it with terminal operator.

---- Simplest way to create Mono is doing :

Mono.just()

    -- Nothing happens in reactor until we subscribe to the publisher (e.g. Mono created above).

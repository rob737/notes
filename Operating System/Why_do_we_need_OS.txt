  User Application --- talks to ----> O.S. kernel APIs ----- talks to -----> Hardware
  
  Notes : 
  1. Kernel APIs will be different for different types of hardware architecture.
  2. Once Process waits for I/O, it is swapped with other process by the Scheduler.


---- System Architecture - Overview of Hardware :  

1. The Kernel is the OS core component that manages hardware etc i.e. it is the component of OS that our application code interacts with.
   Technically, OS is collection of apps which in turn leverages kernel to interact with hardware.
   e.g. top command is an app that uses kernel APIs to get the list of running processes and it's associated resource consumption.
   
-- CPU :

   - CPU has cores.
   - Each core has it's own ALU, CU, Registers, MMU, L1 and L2 cache.
	 However, L3 cache is usually shared among all the cores.

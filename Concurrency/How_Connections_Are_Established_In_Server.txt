----------- Doubt section ----------------------
1. Why do we even need 3 way handshake?
2. What are the other layer 4 protocols that http leverages?
3. Why do we even have so many layers in OSI model?
4. Why does OSI model even exist?
5. what SYN from client to server actually denotes?
6. Why TCP is stateful and what is meant by stateful in the first place?
7. Why do we have public and private IP addresses?
8. What is the difference between router and NIC (Network Interface Card) ?
9. Do we have multiple NICs in the system?
10. what actually port represents? Can same port be used by two processes?
11. can we use same port provided we give different NIC address?
12. If point 11 holds good then listen(8080): does it bind port 8080 on all interfaces and that's why we get address already in use error?
13. How from client request can kernel know that it is for particular APP?

--- There are many ways but most ubiquitos is TCP (layer 4) under http (layer 7).

TCP basically performs 3 way handshake :
1. client sends SYN packet to server.
2. Server responds with it's SYN packet and ACK to acknowledge client syn request.
3. Client sends back it's ACK to acknowledge server's SYN.


Note: Each NIC (Netwrok interface card) has an IP address.

backend listens to the combination of address:port

Note : it is extremely bad practice to just do listen:8080, it signifies that it is accepting requests from all NICs be it public or private and 
may cause security issues.

Client connect to the combination of address and port.
address denotes NIC and port represents the running process.


-------- When we get connection request from client.

app notifies kernel that it is listening to corresponding address:port combination.
and then kernel creates socket file and establish 3 way handshake provided TCP is layer 4 protocol.

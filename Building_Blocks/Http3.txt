Http3 is basically Http over Quic instead of TCP.

Quic however is built on top of UDP.

It is still a streaming protocol just like TCP though barring overheads of TCP like Head of Line blocking,
Flow Control, Congestion control etc. (Well, Beautiful !!!)

In short Http3 is multiplexed stream based on Quic which internally is based on UDP so we don't have inherent TCP bottlenecks.


---- How quick solves TCP head of line blocking problem?

Request is identified in terms of streams and quic manages how many streams are representing a particular request.

So, as soon as all streams representing a request is received by the server and kernel processes it then instantly it sends

acknowledgement back to client instead of checking if all streams of earlier received request are successfully processed or not.

Thus, there is no head of line blocking phenomenon.


--- Pros :

Apart from Streams, it has following benefits :

Note : Quic even though is built on top of UDP has connection concept. It sort of creates virtual connection between client and server.

1. Quic creates connection + TLS handhsake in one handshake i.e. in one round trip.
   TCP would take 3 (TCP) + 4 (TLS) = 7 way handshake. 	
   
2. It has congestion control at stream level.

3. Since, UDP is stateless and Quic creates a virtual connection so it has to send connectionId with every datagram to identify the 
   corresponding connection the packet belongs to.


--- Cons :

1. Takes a lot of CPU resource as it has lots of processing to do like Stream congestion control, flow control, managing connection Ids etc.

2. UDP could be blocked. (Some of the proxies block it).

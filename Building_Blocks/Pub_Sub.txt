1. What is chaining and circuit breaking in Http request/response ?

--- Flow :

Producer publishes something to the server and moves on.

Now, consumer consumes data from the server.

It is designed to solve communication between many clients who can interact with each other, that would have created a mesh.


Client --- Pushes to --- Facade Service (Just my fancy name) and then facade service sends the response back to the client.


Now, facade service will put the data into different topics or within different partition of topic to which a consumer would be subscribed.


This is almost impossible to get it done via normal Http request/response model as it would lead to clients waiting for 
the processing to be done at all services.

Note : Topics or queue would be present on a different server which is usually called a broker.


--- Pros :

1. Scales with multiple receivers

2. Great for microservices

3. Loose coupling

4. Works while consumer is not running

--- Cons :

1. Message delivery issues : Classic two generals problem -- How do I know that the consumer actually got the message?

2. Complex to implement

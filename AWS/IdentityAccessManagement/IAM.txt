-------
We can create groups and assign roles for access.
Groups can only contain users and not other groups.

-----

Policy : JSON document that is used to define permissions for groups or users.

Policy is assigned to group or users.

Least Privilege Principle : Bare minimum access given to perform a job. (Follow this principle in AWS).

We assign tag such that we can perform audit based on those tags.

IAM users are created and assigned groups accordingly.

---------

IAM Policy Structure :

version : policy version
Id : policy distinguished Id
Statement : [Array of information in JSON format]
  : {
  
     SID : statement ID (uniquely identify statement)
	 Effect : Either allow or reject access to a resource
	 Principal : [account/user/role to which this policy is applied]
	 Action: [list of actions this policy allows or denies e.g. "S3:GetObject"]
	 Resource: [list of actual resources/APIS that this policy allows or denies e.g. "arn:aws:S3::mybucket/*"]	
  }
  
We can assign IAM policy at user level (called Inline policy) or at group level.

AWS CLI is open source and alternative AWS management console (website).

AWS SDK : language specific set of libraries .

IAM Roles for services

IAM roles are analogous to users but they are not used by physical people but by AWS services to perform actions.
AWS Entities(services) get credentials for the time they are performing some action with AWS services.

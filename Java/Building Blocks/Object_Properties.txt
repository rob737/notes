Java memory management :

1. Registers : Java programmer doesn't have any control over it.

2. Stack : Designated area in RAM along with stack pointer, only constraint is lifecycle should be known while 
		   putting entry in stack.
		   Note : Objects are not stored on stack as lifecycle can't be decided at compile time.

3. Heap Storage : Designated area in RAM, benefit is compiler need not know lifecycle at compile time.
				  using 'new' operator we create memory space in heap.
				  
4. Constant Values : Constant values are stored along with code.

5. Non-RAM storage : Disk Storage.
					 Stream objects(using streams) and persistent objects(using JDBC/Hibernate).

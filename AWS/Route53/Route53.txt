---------- DNS 

DNS is the program which converts human readable url to it's equivalent IP address.

Terminologies :

1. Domain Registrar : e.g. Amazon Route 53, GoDaddy etc.
2. DNS Records : A, AAAA, CNAME etc.
3. Zone File : contains DNS records
4. Name Server : resolves DNS queries
5. Top Level Domain, Second Level Domain, Sub Domain and FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) as described below :

   http://api.www.example.com.
   
   final . : root
   
   TLD : .com
   Second Level Domain : example.com
   Sub domain : www.example.com
   FQDN : api.www.example.com
   
   protocal : http
   
   
   Flow diagram of DNS resolution :
   
   Let's say we need to connect to www.example.com
   
   Following steps are performed in background :
   
   1. client connects to local DNS Server (created by company or provided automatically by ISP)
   2. Assuming it is first ever access to this domain or is not cached in local DNS server.
   3. Local DNS server makes a call to root DNS (managed by organization called ICANN) and gets in return IP address of DNS which can have information
      about .com domain
   4. Local DNS server now connects to IP address (TLD DNS managed by branch of ICANN called IANA) provided after step 3 and gets IP address of Second Level DNS.
   5. Final call is to Second Level (managed by Domain Registar like Amazon Registrar, Route53 etc) DNS's IP provided in previous step which gives the concerned IP of example.com
   6. This information is cached in Local DNS for further requests
   7. Now, web browser can make a call to corresponding IP address.   
   
   
------------ Route53 :

Route53 is authoritative DNS i.e. users can update the record directly.

Route53 records constitute of following :
1. Domain/Sub domain : e.g. example.com
2. Record type : A/AAAA/CNAME/NS
3. Value : corresponding IP
4. Routing policy : how route53 responds to queries
5. TTL : amount of time the record lives on DNS.


----- Record Types :

1. A - maps hostname to corresponding IPv4 address.
2. AAAA - maps hostname to corresponding IPv6 address.
3. CNAME - maps hostname to another hostname (target is a domain name which must have either A or AAAA record).
4. NS - Name Servers that resolve our DNS queries - basically this is the one that defines routing.
        Alternatively : name servers for the hosted zone.
		e.g www.example.com will be routed to servers with following Ips that can in turn will give you IP for corresponding domain.
		
		
----- Hosted Zone :

A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and it's subdomains.
public hosted zone : internet facing. (contains record that specify how to route traffic on internet)
private hosted zone : internal or within VPC.

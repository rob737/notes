Java has simple concept.
Map every problem in terms of object, 
an object has state(some intrinsic values that can be used to represent building block of problem),
behaviour(state is of no use if we can't access it for some utility which is driven by behaviour), 
identity(We need a mechanism to identify objects uniquely such that we can combine and communicate between objects to solve problem)

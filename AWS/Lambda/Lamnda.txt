--- Serverless:
It basically means we don't have to manually provision or manage servers e.g. auto replication etc.

e.g. S3, Lambda, SQS/SNS, Fargate etc are all serverless.

--- AWS Lambda vs EC2:

-- EC2
 - Virutal servers in the cloud
 - manually provision/manage by defining RAM,vcpu etc 
 - Continuously running even if there is no traffic.
 - Scaling via ASG or manually add more servers.
 
-- Lambda
 - Virtual functions i.e. no server to manage and a function is invoked corresponding to a file.
 - Limited by time i.e. max execution can run for 15 mins straight.
 - Run on-demand and based on traffic
 - Scaling is automated.
 
 
Example of use case of lambda function :

Upload image to S3 -> triggers an event to Lambda -> lambda creates a thumbnail and push it to metadata db and upload thumbnail image to S3. 
 
Note : It's usually very cheap to run code on lambda so it's very popular.
       For 10^6 (1 million requests) are free.

Lambda url : https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=ap-south-1#/begin

--- Use case scenario in lambda functions :

1. Client --(over http/https)--> ALB (Application Load Balancer) ---(Sync Invoke)---> lambda (within a Target Group).

ALB converts HTTP requests into JSON document which serves as input to lambda function.
response from lambda function which is a JSON is converted back to HTTP response by ALB. 


--- Event Source Mapping :

It is primarily used with Kinesis Data Stream, SQS , DynamoDB streams.

All above are pull based which works as follows :

Lambda system is composed of two entities:
1. Event Source Mapping (Internal)
2. Lambda function

SQS --(polled by)--> Event Source Mapping --> gets a return batch with data from SQS --> Invoke lambda function in batch.

lambda function deletes item from the queue.  

--- Event and Context Objects :

Event : JSON-formatted document containing data for lambda function to process.
e.g. input params, invoking service args etc.

Context : 
Provides methods and properties that provide information about the runtime environment, invocation function etc.
e.g. aws_request_id etc.

lambda_handler(event,context) : These two objects are passed by lambda runtime to handler as args.


-- lambda can connect to external services on internet only if VPC is provided with ENI (Elastic Network Interface).

--- Linux Distributions or distros :

Since, linux is open source so many communities and individuals have built distributions on top of original linux which is called as distros.

e.g. ubuntu, fedora, unix, debian, alpine etc.

Note : we will use ubuntu distribution.

-- TO download ubuntu image :

https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu

Commands : Note : ubuntu is the image name

1. To pull and run image :
   
   docker run image_tag
   e.g. docker run ubuntu
   
   Doubt : What is meant by running an image ? is it like we are starting a process executing the steps mentioned in the image?
   
2. To start the container in interactive mode :

	docker run -it ubuntu
	
Note : It starts a shell, shell is a program that takes our command (anything that we type on terminal) and passes it to OS for execution.	

Note : root@2cfdd3ca87db:/# represents shell prompt where root denotes root user, 2cfdd3ca87db denotes machine name, / denotes top level path 
	   and # denotes that we have logged in as root user otherwise it would have been $.

Note : Linux is a case sensitive OS.

3. history : this command gives us the list of commands that we have executed so far.
   
   !<command_number_from_list> will execute the corresponding command.
   
   Example :
   
   root@2cfdd3ca87db:/# history
    1  ls -lrt
    2  whoami
    3  echo $0
    4  history
root@2cfdd3ca87db:/# !3
echo $0
/bin/bash

4. Package manager like npm.
   In ubuntu, we have apt. (Advanced packaged tool)
   
   apt is basically like a repository which has packages present.
   
   apt list will show all the packages available and also the ones that are installed.
   
   apt install <package_name> will install the package but will install only the ones that are present in that package repository.
   
   apt update : It will update the package repository with newer packages which is downloaded from different predefined repos.
   
   apt remove <package_name> : It will unistall corresponding package.
   
Note : In linux, everything is a file including devices, network sockets, directories and so on.

There are couple of fixed directories at top level which are as following : ls /

1. bin : Binaries for programs
2. boot : All the files related to system booting.
3. dev : It represents devices so files that are needed to access devices are stored in this directory.
4. etc : Editable Text Configuration - this is where we have configuration files.
5. home : home directories for different users are stored.
6. root : home directory of root user.
7. lib : keeping library files like software library dependencies etc.
8. var : for keeping files that are updated frequently like block files,application data and so on.
9. proc : files that represent running processes since everything in linux is a file.
10. opt : directory to store manually installed softwares.	
11. usr : directory that stores system needed softwares.

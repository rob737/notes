--- SNS 

Note: This is what is called a PUB/SUB pattern.

Producer puts a message to a "Topic" and from that topic msg goes to all subscribed consumers.

Data is not persisted on topic, it gets lost if not delivered successfully.

-- SNS + SQS Fan out :

producer to topic and topic is subscribed by different queues, this is called SNS + SQS Fan out.

Note : We need to ensure that SQS access policy allows SNS to write on queues.

we also have SNS FIFO with same features as SQS FIFO.

-- SNS Message Filtering :

we can create filter policies at SNS to route the msg to corresponding queue based on msg parameters.

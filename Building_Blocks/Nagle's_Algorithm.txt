1. Since, Nagle's algorithm is applicable only if client expects an acknowledgement so it will not be leveraged when Http is on UDP instead of TCP?

--- This algorithm is one of the primary reasons for delay between client/server communication even though network is good.

This is mostly related to client side delays.

Basically, the gist is that TCP deals in segments.

let's say segment is of size 20 bytes and you are just trying to send 1 byte over the network.

Now, the client O.S. would wait till the segment is full or covering majority of segment until it sends the byte over the network.

MSS is what defines the segment size.

Note: Nagle's algorithm ensures this restriction only if client is expecting any form of acknowledgement from the server.


Note: Most clients today disable Nagle's algorithm by using TCP_NODELAY flag.

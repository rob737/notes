--------------------------------------------- Doubts --------------------------------------------------------------
1. Can we use Http with SOAP instead of REST?
2. Is gRPC also Layer 7 protocol like http?
3. Go through protobuffer video.
4. How protobuf is different from JSON and what advantage does it provide?

gRPC is basically Google Remote Procedure Call.

It leverages Http/2.


---- Why is it even needed or rather what problem is it trying to solve?

Creating a protocol requires consensus between client and server.
Also, the language of protocol must be decided and stick to.

e.g. SOAP library, REST library, Http Client library.


Now, gRPC solves this problem by defining one client library i.e. language for the protocol.
Now, we don't need to maintain SOAP library, REST library etc separately.


---- How it works under the hood?

1. We build protocol buffer (protobuf) that we used in JPMC, this is also called definition file.

2. Then we build specific stubs and these stubs will be used for gRPC in our own language. (This own language concept is not very clear to me).

3. Protocol that is leveraged under the hood is Http/2

4. Message Format : Protocol Buffers as format.


---- gRPC modes :

mode basically represents the mode of communication.

-- Unary gRPC :

It is basically the usual request/response mechanism.

-- Server Streaming gRPC :

It is basically SSE (Server Sent Events).

-- Client Streaming :

Client is streaming the data instead of Server.

-- Bi-directional Streaming :

It is basically webRTC i.e. both client and server are streaming the data.



---- gRPC Pros :

1. Built on top of Http/2 so fast and compact.

2. One client library for interaction between client and server.
    
   What this means is this, communication is via protobuf and grpc itself provides stubs for all languages (supported by Google community)
   to convert request/response to protobuf.
   Hence, we can code in any language but it will get converted to protobuf for transmission and processing.
   
   According to me, REST also does the same so not a valid difference.

3. Request cancellation.


---- gRPC Cons :

1. proto Schema and maintaining it.

2. Proxies are tricky to implement in gRPC.

3. No native Error Handling in gRPC so need to built it on our own.

4. No native Browser support for gRPC unlike Http as it uses some kernel level methods available as part of Http/2

5. Timeouts.

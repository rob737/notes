---------------------------------------------- Doubts -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Read about DHCP 
2. Difference between MAC address and IP address ?
   I think MAC address is to identify the device within the same subnet while IP address is for broader network.

3. Does NIC has IP/MAC address or is there any other hardware in our computer that is assigned the IP/MAC address?

4. Difference between a switch and a router?

5. Messages like ping, traceroute etc are sent through ICMP protocol. Read about it. Also, ICMP is used to send acknowledgements etc.

6. Difference between ISP and default gateway ?

7. What is black hole TCP connection ?

8. Which library ensures that IP packets are following the constraints of MTU and not getting dropped ? is it axios ?

9. Is MTU same as Layer 2 frames?

10. Relation between Internet Protocol, ICMP and utilities like ping?

Answer : Ping is just an IP packet that has ICMP defined as protocol.

-- IP packets deal only with source and destination IP addresses i.e. it is layer 3 protocol.

-- It doesn't care about information from other layers like port from Layer 4 etc.

----- IP address :

It can be set automatically or statically.

IPv4 is 4 bytes i.e. 32 bits.

IP address has network and host portion.

e.g. a.b.c.d/x where x represents the number of bits that represents the network and d represents the host in the network.

e.g. 192.168.254.0/24 , we can have 2^24 networks and 2^8 hosts in each network.

These hosts are also called subnet as in subnetworks within a larger network.

----- Subnet Mask :

It is used to determine whether an IP is in same subnet or another subnet.

It's value is 255.255.255.0

e.g. 192.156.234.5 and 192.234.123.12 are not in the same subnet as 255.255.255.0 & 192.156.234.5 and 255.255.255.0 & 192.234.123.12 are 
not same.

Note: & operation with 255 will effectively give the same number as result. (Why?)

2^8 is 256 but 0 is the loopback address which is reserved so with 8 bits we can have 2^8 -1 combinations which is basically all 1's which equates to 255.

------ Default Gateway :

If hosts are in same subnet then they can interact with each other using MAC addresses.

However, if they are not in the same subnet then source host need to talk to gateway which in turn will forward the packet to destination host or another 
gateway accordingly.

Default gateway also has an assigned IP address. Technically, this is what we call a Router.

Hmm, Interestingly default gateway can have number of IP addresses equal to the number of subnet it connects to.


------- Anatomy of IP Packet :

Ip packet has headers and data sections.

headers are usually 20 bytes while data section can go upto 65536 bytes (i.e. 2^16).

Note: headers with some configurations can go upto 60 bytes.

MTU : Maximum Transmission Unit i.e. maximum number of bytes that can be sent over in a packet.
It's way less than what data section allows.

Best case scenario is that IP packet fits perfectly into MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) also called as frames.

However, if IP Packet doesn't fit into one MTU or one frame then either we can fragment and send our IP packet into multiple frames
or router would drop the package if fragment header is not set in IP packet.

If fragmentation is enabled then receiver host must have some sort of aggregation logic for aggregating frames of same packet
because frames would not be received in order.

Below list explains the different header flags that is present in IP packet :

-- Version : Spreads over 4 bits which represents either IPv4 or IPv6 currently. However, it can represent upto 2^4-1 versions.

-- IHL (Internet Header Length) : Defines how long the options block would be in header, by default header is 20 bytes excluding options.
	we can configure IHL flag to expand header size by using options block. However, all routes doesn't support this.

-- Total Length : 8 bit flag that represents total size of the packet i.e. including data + header + options.

-- flags : one of the values is set to decide whether fragmentation is needed or not.

-- Time To Live : A number that represents how many hops can this packet survive? It is of size 8 bits so we can represent 2^8 hops.

Note: IP protocol is stateless.

-- Protocol : It tells us which protocol is inside data i.e. layer 4 is showed into layer 3 and so we would need someway to identify which layer 4 protocol 
	is our packet carrying.
	e.g. TCP, UDP, ICMP  etc.
	
-- Source and Destination IP : 4 bytes each representing source and destination host IP addresses.

Note : Spoofing is basically changing source IP address to something else to impersonate as someone else.

Note : ISP is basically the default gateway or the first gateway that packet from our laptop goes through to the internet.

-- ECN : Explicit Congestion Notification : Congestion is basically when router is flooded with packets and it has started dropping packets.
	Router puts packet in memory (effectively called buffer) and once the buffer fills up, it starts dropping packages.
	
	ECN flag is leveraged to identify if any router in the path is experiencing congestion.
	Let's say at hop3 ECN bit was set by some router then at next hop, receiver/router will somehow notify the client that congestion is there in the 
	network. This congestion control is managed by TCP.
	

---- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

This is the most critical protocol that lives in layer 3.	

It is designed for informational messages like Host unreachable, port unreachable, fragmentation needed, packet expired etc.

Note: It doesn't need port or listeners to be opened as it is layer 3 protocol which deals only with IP.

ICMP can be used if it is allowed by host.

Just to understand, a protocol is the language and packet is the actual unit in which communication is carried out.
So, some constituent of packet will tell us in which language is the communication happening.

So, IP packet is the unit of communication in Layer 3 which will tell us which language it belongs to like ICMP, TCP etc.


Note: Some firewalls either block or timeout ICMP packets.

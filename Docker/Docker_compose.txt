---- what is docker compose and why do we even need it?

To manage multiple containers.
For example : let's say you want one container to only be up when some other container is up i.e. you have depedency of
container A on container B and so on.

If we are not using docker-compose then we would need to manually check above constraint.

docker compose is built on top of docker engine.

Note: we can use $(command) to execute the command dynamically and in conjunction with other commands.

Example : docker image rm $(docker image ls -q) : It will remove all images.

--- 

cd to directory where docker-compose.yml is present and do docker-compose up to start all the necessary containers.


---- JSON and YAML formats :

List are represented as separated rows using hyphen. 

e.g. 
in json, "tags" : [a,b]

in yml,
	tags :
		- a
		- b
		
Note : parsing yml file is slower than parsing JSON as every value in yml is considered string and then it is type casted to correct datatype.		


---- Understanding docker compose files :

Only  Supported filenames: docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, compose.yml, compose.yaml

#This version must comply with docker engine as suggested by docker docs.
version: "3.8"
#services are the fundamental building blocks (represented as unique containers) of our app like db, elastic search, frontend, backend etc.
#Note: names are arbitrary and can be given anything
services:
  web:
    #we would need to define properties inside each service that would be used to build images and serve as input while running containers. In this way, we would need not execute the commands manually from terminal as we were doing it earlier.
    #Note : docker compose will take care of starting the container under the hood and we need not execute docker run command manually.
    #build parameter expects path of individual services dockerfile to build image and run container
    build: ./frontend
    #ports is an array of port mapping from host to container
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - 3001:3001
    #environment to define environment variables
    #Note: when we using docker compose then under the hood network is created with number of hosts equal to number of services defined and host address is identified by service name and hence, we were able to use db in mongo connection string below as hostname and vidly is database name.
    environment:
      #instead of list, we can use normal notation as well.
      #- DB_URL=mongodb://database/vidly
      DB_URL: mongodb://database/vidly
  database:
    #image property allows us to download image from docker hub directly.
    image: mongo:4.0-xenial
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    #volumes is to create one or more volume mappings. <volume_on_host>:<mapped_to_directory_in_container>
    #So, whatever would be written in /data/db will be mapped to vidly. Since, we have defined volume we would need to define it in this file as property (e.g. volumes property is at the same level as services property).
    volumes:
      - vidly:/data/db
#This is just to define volume vidly and only then we can use it, mostly like concept of variable
volumes:
  vidly:


---- Building images using docker-compose :

docker-compose build --no-cache

---- Starting and Stopping the application :

docker-compose up to run all the images defined in docker-compose file.

docker-compose ps to list all the running containers.

Note: docker-compose commands gets executed to each of the services defined in docker-compose file and not to individual service.

docker-compose down will stop and remove the containers but images will still be there.


----- Docker Networking :

when running application with docker compose, it creates a network of all defined containers in docker-compose.yml file.
For our use case (defined above in docker-compose.yml file), we have 3 containers (database, backend, frontend) in a default network 
created by docker.

Every container has an associated IP address.

Docker engine has inbuilt DNS server and each container has embedded DNS resolver which communicates with DNS server to find the IP of 
other container to connect to.

e.g. API container would need to connect to DB container etc.

Note: 

you can sh to one container and from there you can refer other container using service name defined in docker-compose.yml file.

command to see all networks : docker network ls

----- Viewing logs :

docker-compose logs : will give logs for all services.

docker logs <container_id>

------ Publishing changes :

#same (volume) property is also used to create symlink between our directory/files and container's files/directory 
such that we need not rebuild the images everytime even for small changes
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
	  
------ Migrating the database :	

Similar to flyway or sequelize.

    # It will override the default command in our docker file.
    #wait-for is a third party library and is useful to check if dependent service is ready or not
    # before executing further commands.
    #In below example, we are waiting to receive traffic on port 27017 for service db.
    command: ./wait-for db:27017 && npm run db:up &&npm start

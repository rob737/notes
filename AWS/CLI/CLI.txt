---- CLI :

**** ALL BELOW COMMANDS NEEDS TO BE EXECUTED AFTER LOGIN TO EC2 INSTANCE ****

some commands (not all) have --dry-run option to simulate original command and save time.

---- To look into encoded error stack trace of CLI command :

aws sts decode-authorization-message --encoded-message <error msg>


---- AWS EC2 instance metadata.

Below IP can be hit only from EC2 instance to know about various metadata.

http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data.


----- profile :

we can setup aws profile for different aws accounts that would have their own access key and access tokens.

command : aws configure --profile <aws-account-name or any other name>


sts get-session-token : to generate session token valid for a particular duration.


---- SDK (Software Development Kit) :

SDK has to be used to interact with AWS via code.

by deafult sdk configure's region to us-east-1 if no region is specified explicitly.

---- API Rate limiting and exponential backoff :

If we get ThrottlingException intermittently :

If our API calls exceed expected API rate limit then we can leverage exponential backoff strategy for intermittent issues.

exponential backoff :wait time doubles after every 5XX exception (server errors).

If our API calls exceed rate limit too often then we need to increase limit on API call.


---- Security Credentials are looked into below order :

1. CLI
2. Environment variables
3. profile configuration

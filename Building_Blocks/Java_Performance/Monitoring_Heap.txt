---- What is a soft leak?

Note: Visual VM is the tool to visualize how much heap is being utilized currently.

Soft leaks is not an official term but it refers to objects that remains referenced even when it is no longer needed.

It may be due to bad practices in coding or due to some third party library.

This is a real possibility in a web server.



J Visual VM allows us to view stack and the heap.

We would need to download it separately for open JDK but it's present in oracle JDK.

I have installed it : 

execute visualvm command to open it.

Commands to install on ubuntu 20.04 :

1. sudo apt update


2. sudo apt install visualvm


3. jvisualvm

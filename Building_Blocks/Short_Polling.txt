1. In short polling, does it perform 3 way handshake everytime it polls or does it re-use underlying connection after creating it for the first time ?

Answer : It creates a new connection.

--- Short polling :

It is used in cases where async processing is being done and client intermittently checks if the submitted task is completed or not.

As a thumb rule, when request takes a long time to process.


--- Steps in short polling :

1. Client sends a request to server.

2. Server returns immediately with a handle/jobId/taskId which will be used by client to check for the status of task.

3. Server either queues the request or start processing it.

4. Multiple "short" request/response as polls is being made by client using handle as identifier to check for the status.


--- PROS :

1. Simple to implement.
2. Good for long running tasks.
3. Client can disconnect.

--- CONS :

1. Too chatty as too many requests are made.

2. Wasted network bandwidth as each poll creates TCP connection.

3. Wasted backend resources as kernel would perform tasks and then backend will have to execute the logic whether task is ready or not.

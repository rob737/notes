---------- Doubts -------------
1. what is CSRF attack and what is the use of CSRF token?

2. What is Cross site scripting attack?

3. What is broken authentication ?

4. How do we whitelist some endpoints to be not part of Spring Security authentication?

5. Is each endpoint mapped to one servlet class ?
Ans : No, each servlet can be mapped to multiple endpoints by mapping url patterns.

---------- XXXXX ---------------



Security like availability, scalability and performance are non functional requirements.

Clients won't ask for non functional requirement but it is a must to have.


Note: we would need to use @ComponentScan with argument as corresponding folder path for Spring context to load up corresponding
	  beans in Spring context.

Note: whenever we add Spring Security dependency then we would need to supply username and password to access our applications with 
	  default username as user and password would be auto generated by spring security on the console.	
	  

---- Servlets and Filters :

So HTTP protocol is not understood by our Java business code.

Hence, we need some mechanism to convert payload in HTTP request to constructs which Java can comprehend.
This work is done by servlet containers (web server) like Tomcat.

Servlet container converts the HttpRequest to ServletRequest object and hand it over to servlet as parameter.

So, Java web apps are drived by Servlet i.e. Servlet are the building blocks of web application.
	  
Similarly, we have filters which can be used to intercept each request before forwarding it to Servlet.


Client --- request ---> Filters ---> Servlets

App/Web server basically comprises of Filters and Servlets.

Note: Spring security uses these filters only for enforcing security constraints.
 

---- Building blocks of Spring Security :

1. Spring Security Filters : This is the first point of contact for client's request.
							 It forms Authentication object and can be used to perform first level of authentication.

2. Authentication object : This is the POJO on which authentication business logic would be performed.

3. Authentication Manager : This takes Authentication object as input and based on certain criteria delegate it to Authentication Providers
							which actually has the business logic to perform validation.

4. Authentication Provider : These are the actual classes where business logic for authentication and authorization is present.
							 It will leverage inbuilt classes (e.g. Password Encoder, UserDetails Manager/Service) to perform the operation 
							 or we can create our custom implementation as well.

5. Security Context : After performing all 4 operations above, Authentication object is stored in Security Context which is basically used as a
					  session to allow subsequent requests to pass on without re-performing all validation steps.	
									
Note: Revisit this section and distinguish classes and interfaces among building blocks.
									

---- Important Filters to be aware of :

1. AuthorizationFilter.java

2. DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter.java

3. UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.java

4. ProviderManager.java (Implementation of AuthneticationManager)

5. DaoAuthenticationProvider.java.
   However, by default we have AnonymousAuthenticationProvider.java which implements interface AuthenticationProvider.

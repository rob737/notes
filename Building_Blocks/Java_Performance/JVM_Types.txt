1. How to know which application is using a particular processId or rather which application is denoted by a processId?

Maximum Heap size that can be set is OS dependent.

In 32 bit, only C1 compiler is present. (refer Byte_code notes in case forgotten about C1).

In 64 bit, both C1 and C2 compiler is present.

C1 is also called client compiler.

C2 is also called server compiler.


JVM heuristically decides which code block to be compiled to native language and store it in code cache by the frequency of the
code block.


java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal

After executing above command in terminal, we will get a long list of JVM flags with value that is set.

one of them is : 

intx CICompilerCount                          = 4                                         {product} {ergonomic}

It denotes the number of threads available to JIT compile our byte code to native instructions.

jps : this command will list all the running java processes.


we can get the info of any of the flag (like CICompilerCount) for any of the process using jinfo command.

Syntax : jinfo -flag CICompilerCount <pid>


To give this as VM args in cases where we want to increase the number of threads used for JIT compilation :

use -XX:CICompilerCount=<any_number>



-XX:CompileThreshold=n -- This is the flag that controls how many times must the code block be executed before it's native code is put into code cache.

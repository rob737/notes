--- Annotations :

Annotations allow us to store extra information about our program that is tested and verified by the compiler.
e.g. @override -> this will throw exception if overriden method's signature changes from base method.

or @Test ::

These annotations doesn't do anything in itself but compiler ensures that there is definition of annotation present in build path.

e.g. 

//: annotations/UseCase.java
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface UseCase {
public int id();
public String description() default "no description";
}

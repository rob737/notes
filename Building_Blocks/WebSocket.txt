------------------------------- Doubts ----------------------------------
1. What exactly is the difference between Websocket and SSE ? Both would leverage TCP connection right?
   Why can't we have bi-directional communication in SSE as both have underlying persisted TCP connection?	
   
   SSE is basically like establishing a very long request which server can send the events to without closing the connection.
   Hence, overhead of websocket handshake is saved plus extra processing to maintain states.



------------------------------- XXXXX  ----------------------------------


Websocket sits on top of Http.

It provides bi-directional communication between client and server.


First step is that client initiates websocket handshake with server which is basically a HTTP request to ask server to 
start communication in websocket protocol.

Once, server replies on the above handshake request then client and server can communicate (bi-directionally) over websocket protocol.

Note: It will work only with Htt1.1 as we need to keep the connection alive.


---- Websocket handhsake :

ws:// or wss:// (wss is basically secured websocket).


Steps :

1. Client initiates GET 1.1 Upgrade request to server.

2. Server responds with 101 - Switching Protocol response.

Now, after step 2 , client-server communication is websocket enabled.

Upgrade header is a special header that is understood by server.


---- Websocket use cases :

- Chatting

- Live Feed

- Multiplayer Gaming

- Anything that needs to be real time or chatting.


---- Pros :

- Full duplex so no polling is required.

- Http Compatible

- It is Firewall friendly because it is Http compatible.


---- Cons :

- Proxying is tricky as they would need to read incoming data from client and pass that data to server by creating new websocket connection 
  between client and server.

- L7 LB timeouts may happen as websocket is long living connections.

- Stateful and hence it is relatively difficult to horizontally scale as states need to be maintained on every host.


If bi-directional communication is not needed frquently then it's better to use Long Polling or SSE.

------ Composition :

Create object of existing class in new class and use it's functionality.
This means that new class is composed of existing class.

e.g. order and purchase

------ Inheritance :

Create an entirely new type based on the type of existing class and override functionality using polymorphism.

e.g. User and doctor.


toString() : this method is called when a compiler wants a String but it has an object.

By default, every class is sub class of Object class.

class A extends B { // At this point, we get all the "accessible" members of base class B in A.

}

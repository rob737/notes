---- What is a transaction ?

A transaction is a collection of operations on the physical and abstract application state.

Begin transaction;


<Set of operations within Transaction>


Commit Transaction;

In case of failure, Rollback transaction pipeline would be triggered.

---- RPC :

Remote procedure calls (RPCs) are a way for one process to invoke a program in another remote process as though the subroutine in the remote process were local.


---- Memory :

At a low level of abstraction, the memory looks like an array of bytes to the processor; but at the processor instruction set level, 
there is already a memory-mapping mechanism that translates logical addresses (virtual memory addresses) to physical addresses. 
This mapping hardware is manipulated by the operating system software to give the processor a virtual address space at any instant. 
The processor executes instructions from virtual memory, and it reads and alters bytes from the virtual memory.


---- Electronic Memory :

Bit is identified by electronic charge i.e. if charged then 1 else 0.

Main/Primary Memory : RAM

Secondary Memory : Disk

Processor cannot directly access secondary memory.

A block of memory say 10 KB (Kilo Bytes) is copied to main memory from secondary memory and then processor accesses it.

Since, speed of memory and processor is different so we need to have a cache on processor itself that will allow processor
to continue execution rather than waiting for memory to provide instructions.
